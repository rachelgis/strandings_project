This data is provided under the terms of the licence included with the data: "The James Hutton Institute Open Data Licence (download).pdf".

The zip file contains a shapefile of the current (2020) published version of the 1:250,000 Soils of Scotland. If you are unable to access the metadata embedded in the shapefile please refer to the PDF Soils_250K_metadata_export.pdf included.

This is Version 1.4 and 1.3 of the data. Version 1.3 contained some minor polygon corrections but retained the symbology from 1.2 (MAPSYMB13). In version 1.4 the symbology has been updated so that it now uses the attribute "MAPSYMB16", however, the data is unchanged from v1.3. Layerfiles are included for both 1.3 and 1.4 versions and the same shapefile may be used to display either symbology.
